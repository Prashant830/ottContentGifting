// method for receiver encrypted  algo !


// First one method for check what certificate licenece will get form frontent 
// for video playing after that decrypt this method oif it is correct
// certificate for that do permission to open the content for non - subscriber !
// if it is wrong certificate then return unvailed value to non-subscriber by this non - subscriber not able to open it !
// console.log("certificate vailidation")

// second one method to genrate the certifiacte for indiviual video (certificate genrated algorithmn)!
// console.log("genrate certificate algorithmn!")


// this whole logic for implement the certificate , or licenece vailidation, genrated drm! 



// these are my main questions basically -

// first one this drm is a back-end  or any other plateform just implement our logic here !
// if it is platformn then we also able to make a vailidated backend for decrypting !
// it is very simple to implement for frontent!
